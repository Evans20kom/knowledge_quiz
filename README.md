## Credits

A number of sources were used for the development of this application:

<ul>
<li>Chris H - Central Grader: On the challenge for week 3, they alerted me to the fact that the presentation of my README file is not the expected one; upon investigating, I realized that markdown syntax was not correct</li>
<li>CG Collin - Central Grader: After grading the challenge for week 4, they confirmed that the corrections I made to the README file were acceptable; based on this feedback, I maintained the previous REAME file structure as a template for future projects.</li>
</ul>
